    #Letters - A to Z , a to z (means it does not contain letters of bengali aur punjabi only english alphabet)
    #Digits - 0 to 9

    #WhiteSpace - Blank Space, tab, carriage return , new line, formfeed
    #Other charracters - Python can process all ASCII and Unicode characters as part of data or literals

# Note : python does not have multiline comment but You can use triple quotes (''' or """) to create a multiline string. While these are technically not comments (they are string literals), if they are not assigned to a variable or used in any way, they are effectively ignored by the interpreter

This is a multiline string,
but it can be used as a comment
if left unassigned.

# Variables

     #Variables are names given to a memory location in a program

name="Sonal"
age=23 #note it stores the value from right to left (Assignment rule)
price=25.25

#Printing variable value

print(name)
print("my name is ",name)
print("my age is ",age)

age2=age

print(age2)

# Identifiers

# Identifiers in Python are the names used to identify variables,functions, classes, modules, or other objects. 
# They act as unique labels that allow you to reference these entities in your code.
#Identifier vs variable

""" 

Identifiers are names used in Python to identify entities like variables, functions, classes, or modules. They act as labels for these objects. For example, my_function is an identifier for a function, or MyClass is an identifier for a class. Identifiers donâ€™t store any data themselves; they are simply names.

The name x is both an identifier and a variable. Here's why:

As an Identifier:

x is the name used to identify a specific entity in the program.
It serves as the label for the memory location where the value 42 is stored.
As a Variable:

x is specifically being used to hold the value 42, making it a variable.
A variable always associates an identifier with a value or object in memory.
So, in this case, x functions as both an identifier (a name) and a variable (storing a value).

"""

#Rules of identifier

""" Allowed Characters:

Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
Can be followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
No special characters (like @, $, %) are allowed. 

Case Sensitivity:

Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning Variable and variable are different.

Keywords:

You cannot use Python reserved keywords as identifiers. For example, if, else, class, and def cannot be used.

Copy code

No Spaces:

Identifiers cannot contain spaces. Use underscores (_) for readability in multi-word identifiers.

Special Characters and Rules:

Identifiers can start with an underscore. Identifiers starting with a single underscore (e.g., _variable) or double underscores (__variable) have special meanings in Python (like private variables or built-in special methods).
